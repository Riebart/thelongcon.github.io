    <h4>What Is It?</h4>
    <p>The Long Con was first held in 2013 under the banner of BSides Winnipeg, and showcased speakers presenting to a sold-out venue over the course of a weekend. Our second and third events were held in 2015 and 2017, also selling out. All presentations from previous years can be found in our archive.</p>

    <h4>Participating</h4>
    <p>If you have any questions about how to participate in the event, either as a <a href="/speakers/">speaker</a> or a <a href="/sponsors/">sponsor</a>, please <a href="/contact/">contact the Organizers</a>.</p>

    <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
    <p>We have no tolerance for physical/verbal/sexual harassment!</p>

    <p>Asking questions of a speaker during their talk, to get clarity or debate a point is not harassment &ndash; heckling or haranguing the speaker is. If you are not sure, ask, or err on the side of basic decency and common courtesy. If what they are doing would not be acceptable to have done to you, your best friend, your worst enemy, your sister, niece, daughter, brother, nephew, son, mother, father, or any human being, do not let them treat anyone else that way &ndash; whether you know them or not. If someone asks you to stop &ndash; stop.</p>

    <p>If you are having an issue with another participant of any badge type, find a conference Organizer (wearing a red The Long Con t-shirt), or ask a conference Volunteer (wearing a yellow The Long Con t-shirt) to find you an Organizer. The Organizer will take an official incident report and determine next steps.</p>

    <p>The Long Con reserves the right to revoke admission for the current event, without refund if revoked during the event itself, or all future events if a participant is not being excellent to other attendees. "Being excellent" is intentionally vague due to the difficulty of defining the bounds of appropriate and inappropriate behaviour, and so it means whatever the Organizers decide on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <p>For other non-conference related harassment concerns, <a href="/contact/">contact the Organizers</a> for assistance.</p>

    <p>Policy graciously borrowed from BSidesSF, with minor alterations.</p>
